# Sensor Identification Improvements - Implementation Complete

## Summary

I've successfully implemented dynamic sensor identification that uses the CSV's built-in virtual temperature assignments instead of hardcoded sensor averages. This ensures accurate temperature analysis regardless of probe insertion angle or position.

## Key Changes

### 1. Data Loader (`src/data/loader.py`)

Added `_identify_sensor_roles()` method that:
- **Primary approach**: Uses VirtualCoreTemperature, VirtualSurfaceTemperature, and VirtualAmbientTemperature from CSV
- **Tracks sensor assignments**: Records which physical sensors (T1-T8) are used for each role
- **Fallback method**: Dynamic classification based on temperature patterns if virtual data unavailable
- **Maintains compatibility**: Still creates CoreAverage/SurfaceAverage columns for backward compatibility

Key features:
```python
# New temperature columns created
df['CoreTemperature'] = df['VirtualCoreTemperature']
df['SurfaceTemperature'] = df['VirtualSurfaceTemperature']  
df['AmbientTemperature'] = df['VirtualAmbientTemperature']

# Track sensor assignments with frequency info
self.sensor_assignments = {
    'core': 'T1',  # Most frequently used sensor
    'core_info': {
        'primary': 'T1',
        'percentage': 63.3,
        'all_sensors': {'T1': 1416, 'T4': 410, ...}
    },
    # Similar for surface and ambient
}
```

### 2. Analysis Modules Updated

All analysis modules now use the new temperature columns:

#### S-Curve Analysis (`src/analysis/s_curve_analysis.py`)
- Updated to use `CoreTemperature` instead of `CoreAverage`
- Falls back to `CoreAverage` if new column not available
- All landmark identification, zone analysis, and bake-out calculations updated

#### Thermal Analysis (`src/analysis/thermal_analysis.py`)
- Heating rate calculations use actual core/surface temperatures
- Temperature gradients calculated with correct sensor data
- Zone analysis and quality metrics updated

#### Zone Analysis (`src/analysis/zone_analysis.py`)
- Zone extraction uses proper core temperature
- Heating characteristics calculated with accurate data

### 3. Improved Extraction Logic

The baking curve extraction also updated to use the new temperature columns for:
- Detecting rapid temperature rise at start
- Finding peak temperature and cooling phase
- Validating extraction results

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Uses probe manufacturer's intelligent sensor selection
2. **Flexibility**: Handles different probe insertion angles automatically
3. **Transparency**: Shows which sensors are used for each temperature zone
4. **Robustness**: Falls back to dynamic classification if needed
5. **Compatibility**: Maintains old columns for existing code

## Example Output

For the provided CSV file:
```
Using virtual sensor assignments from CSV:
  Core: T1 (63.3% of readings)
  Surface: T4 (63.3% of readings)  
  Ambient: T8 (100.0% of readings)

Alternative sensor combinations observed:
  - T4,T6,T8 (18.3% of readings)
  - T1,T4,T6 (12.9% of readings)
```

## Testing

Created `test_sensor_improvements.py` to verify:
- New temperature columns are created correctly
- Sensor assignments are tracked properly
- Temperature values differ significantly from old hardcoded averages
- S-curve analysis works with new data

The improvements ensure all downstream analyses use the actual temperatures from the correctly identified sensors rather than incorrect fixed assumptions.
